**NASLib** is a modular and flexible framework created with the aim of providing a common codebase to the community to facilitate research on **Neural Architecture Search** (NAS). It offers high-level abstractions for designing and reusing search spaces, interfaces to benchmarks and evaluation pipelines, enabling the implementation and extension of state-of-the-art NAS methods with a few lines of code. The modularized nature of NASLib
allows researchers to easily innovate on individual components (e.g., define a new
search space while reusing an optimizer and evaluation pipeline, or propose a new
optimizer with existing search spaces). It is designed to be modular, extensible and easy to use.

NASLib was developed by the [**AutoML Freiburg group**](https://www.automl.org/team/) and with the help of the NAS community, we are constantly adding new _search spaces_, _optimizers_ and _benchmarks_ to the library. Please reach out to zelaa@cs.uni-freiburg.de for any questions or potential collaborations.

# Setup

While installing the repository, creating a new conda environment is recomended. [Install PyTorch GPU/CPU](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) for your setup.

```bash
conda create -n mvenv python=3.7
conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio cudatoolkit=11.1 -c pytorch -c nvidia
```

Run setup.py file with the following command, which will install all the packages listed in [`requirements.txt`](requirements.txt)
```bash
pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
pip install -e .
```

To validate the setup, you can run tests:

```bash
cd tests
coverage run -m unittest discover -v
```

The test coverage can be seen with `coverage report`.

# Usage

To get started, check out [`demo.py`](examples/demo.py).

```python
search_space = SimpleCellSearchSpace()

optimizer = DARTSOptimizer(config)
optimizer.adapt_search_space(search_space)

trainer = Trainer(optimizer, config)
trainer.search()        # Search for an architecture
trainer.evaluate()      # Evaluate the best architecture
```

For more examples see [naslib tutorial](examples/naslib_tutorial.ipynb), [intro to search spaces](examples/search_spaces.ipynb) and [intro to predictors](examples/predictors.md).

## Contributing
We welcome contributions to the library along with any potential issues or suggestions. Please create a pull request to the Develop branch.
